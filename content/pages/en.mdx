title: "Welcome to the C++ Tutorial"
---

Welcome to cpptutorial.org. This tutorial targets experienced programmers with limited C++ background. Maybe you take your college data structure course in C++ and want to learn more. Maybe you want a transition into C++. Or maybe you are like me, who learn new programming languages for fun. On the other hand, if you are new to programming in general, this tutorial may not fit for you.

You should already understand the basic programming concepts, including variables, control flows, and functions. This tutorial, however, walks through how to express those concepts in C++ in chapter 1.

The tutorial is built in a linear fashion such that it does not refer to concepts or language constructs not introduced previously. Nevertheless, if you have a decent C++ background, feel free to skip sections you already understand.

I believe in the value of project-based learning. Thus, from chapter 5, each chapter will be accompanied by a programming exercise at the end. I encourage you to treat then as assignments - first, solve it yourself, and then look at my solution.

Notice that this tutorial is in its very early stage. Thus, everything, including the table of contents, is subject to change.
