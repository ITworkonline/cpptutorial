Now let's look at some simple C++ code.
Below is a C++ program that prints `"Hello world!\n"` to the standard output.

```cpp
#include <cstdio>

auto main() -> int {
  std::puts("Hello world!");
}
```

This program already composed some fundamental concepts in C++. Donâ€™t be overwhelmed as we will take a look at the code line by line.

**`#include`**

`#include` is a preprocessor instruction that includes other C++ source files into our current source file.
In the "hello world" example, we `#include` the file `<cstdio>`.
`<cstdio>` is the C-style input/output library,
and contains the standard library function `puts` among many others.

**`auto main() -> int`**

A lot of programming languages, such as Python, Javascript, or Ocaml, interpret and execute source code from up to bottom.
By contrast, C++ is one of those languages that has one unique entry point called the `main()` function,
and every C++ program starts to execute from here.

The syntax `auto f() -> int` means we **declare** a function `f` that takes no arguments and returns `int`.
`main()` is special because despite it returns an integer, you do not need to specify a return value; it returns `0` by default.
The integer returns by main indicates the **exit state** of the program; a value of `0` means no error.
Returning any numbers other than `0` tells the operating system that something is wrong when executing the program.
For example:

```cpp notip=true
#include <cstdio>

auto main() -> int {
  if (something_is_wrong()) {
    return 42;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

The version of `main()` function showed above uses **trailing return type**, and this tutorial will use it consistently.
This trailing return type version is equivalent to the following version:

```cpp notip=true
#include <cstdio>

-auto main() -> int {
+int main() {
  std::puts("Hello world!");
}
```

The usage of the trailing return type is mainly for a stylish reason, but there are cases where you must use the trailing return type.

** `{...}` **

The curly braces `{` and `}` indicate the begin and end of the `main()` function.
The pair of curly braces with function body following the function declaration turns it into a **function definition**.

**`std::puts("Hello world!");`**

`puts` output the string `"hello world!"` to the standard output and automatically append an end line character (`\n`) at the end of the output stream.
`std` is a **namespace**, and all the symbols of the C++ standard library are declared within `std`.
To call a standard library function, you need to *qualify* your function call with the namespace `std`.
