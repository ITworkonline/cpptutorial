I will talk about the tools you need to get started.

I will also start to introduce some basic C++ syntax, and give you a feeling on how the language looks.

## What do you need
### A compiler and an linker
Those tools transform C++ source code into executables.

### An editor

## Optional tools that we will talk about later
### A debugger

### A build system

### Compiler Explorer
